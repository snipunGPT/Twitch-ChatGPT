# Twitch-ChatGPT

All credit goes to nugrunonly (twitch.tv/nugrunonly).

This code (chatGPT.py) will authenticate a Twitch bot account (config.py) to await messages directed to it in Twitch chat, ask OpenAI (authenticated with credentials.py), and respond to the user pretending to be the personality set (personality.txt).
